# IprwcAPI

This is a Dropwizard back-end for a PoC webshop as part of a school project. There is of course no shipping or payment as this is only a PoC.

Possible code improvements:
- Stricter use of the layer architecture
- A role system that's more than just a boolean (lmao)
- Expiration of JWT Tokens
- Combining several tables into one response (i.e. wishlist items)
- Some HTML responses could be better
- ~~Not using Dropwizard~~

Check out https://github.com/mr0x13f/iprwc-client/ for the corresponding front-end.
For the time being the webshop is live at https://weebshop.hydrateyourself.moe/.
It will die eventually when the jks expires and I'm too lazy to fix it.
