# IprwcAPI

This is a Java/Dropwizard back-end for a webshop CRUD PoC as part of a school project.

Possible code improvements:
- Stricter use of the layer architecture
- Role based user authorization instead of an admin flag
- JWT Token expiration
- Combining several tables into one response (i.e. wishlist items)
- Some HTML responses could be better
- Not using Dropwizard

See https://github.com/mr0x13f/iprwc-client/ for the corresponding front-end.
